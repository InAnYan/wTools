  This file demonstrates a simple system that will guide user in learning languages.
  Its main purpose consists of answering user question using another language + providing translation to
  user's mother tongue + set of used unique words with their translations.
  For example: user may ask in their language - "why the sky is blue?", the model will then explain it in
  the target language, then provide a translation of its output in original language, and additionaly
  the system will provide a set of used frases with their translations.
  Currently, system is set for English learning for Ukrainian speakers.
